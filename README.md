# Fault-Tolerant-Edge-Detection
This project involves a fault tolerant design of an image processing application.
We have chosen a "Prewitt Filter" based edge detection to detect edges in gray scale bmp input images.
We have incorporated Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) for this application. ABFT involves encoding matrices and operating on encoded matrices.
If faults are injected into the elements of the matrices, ABFT allows us to detect, locate and correct the faults.
